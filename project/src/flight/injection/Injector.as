	 * Injector allows dependency injection to occure using the display list as
	 * a contextual separation point between instances. The display heirarchy
	 * allows an easy way to control context.
	 * 
	 * If an instance of Injector is added via MXML or created and passed a
	 * display object, it will inject any views added to the stage underneath
	 * the display object it is attached to.
	 * 
	 * A "subject" is an object which needs to be provided with instances of
	 * required Classes.
	 * 
	 * To "inject" a subject is to provide that subject with instances of objects
	 * that it is expecting of a certain type, belonging to its context.
	 * 
	 * An "injection" is an object that can be provided to subjects through inject.
	 * They are simply objects that have been registered in a certain context
	 * using the <code>provideInjection</code> method.
	 * 
	 * A "context" is a given display object including its parents on the
	 * display list. If an injection is providedd on the root of the application
	 * then any subject being injected under any context on the display list
	 * can receive that injection.
