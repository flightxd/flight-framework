		 * Adds a method that hooks into the setter process of an observable

		 * 
		 * To cancel the property change, return the oldValue. This means there
		 * is no change and the remaining hooks and observers will not be run.
		 * 
		 * To alter the new property value return the desired value.
		 * 
		 * If no value is returned at all, the process will continue as if that
		 * hook hadn't run. This will also be the case if newValue
		 * is returned unchanged.

		 * delimited string of properties may be used to add one hook to

		 * @param The hook host is the object which the hook method belongs to.
		 * It is needed to ensure a weak-referenced system. If the hook does not
		 * have an IEventDispatcher it belongs to, null
		 * may be passed in, but the hook must be referenced directly by a
		 * property due to how weak-referenced dictionaries hold functions.

		 * </code>
		 * This is only needed if hookHost is null;
		 *
